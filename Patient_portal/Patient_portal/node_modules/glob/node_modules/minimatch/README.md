# minimatch

A minimal matching utility.

This is the matching library used internally by npm.

It works by converting glob expressions into JavaScript `RegExp`
objects.

## Usage

```js
// hybrid module, load with require() or import
import { minimatch } from 'minimatch'
// or:
const { minimatch } = require('minimatch')

minimatch('bar.foo', '*.foo') // true!
minimatch('bar.foo', '*.bar') // false!
minimatch('bar.foo', '*.+(bar|foo)', { debug: true }) // true, and noisy!
```

## Features

Supports these glob features:

- Brace Expansion
- Extended glob matching
- "Globstar" `**` matching
- [Posix character
  classes](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pattern-Matching.html),
  like `[[:alpha:]]`, supporting the full range of Unicode
  characters. For example, `[[:alpha:]]` will match against
  `'é'`, though `[a-zA-Z]` will not. Collating symbol and set
  matching is not supported, so `[[=e=]]` will _not_ match `'é'`
  and `[[.ch.]]` will not match `'ch'` in locales where `ch` is
  considered a single character.

See:

- `man sh`
- `man bash` [Pattern
  Matching](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pattern-Matching.html)
- `man 3 fnmatch`
- `man 5 gitignore`

## Windows

**Please only use forward-slashes in glob expressions.**

Though windows uses either `/` or `\` as its path separator, only `/`
characters are used by this glob implementation. You must use
forward-slashes **only** in glob expressions. Back-slashes in patterns
will always be interpreted as escape characters, not path separators.

Note that `\` or `/` _will_ be interpreted as path separators in paths on
Windows, and will match against `/` in glob expressions.

So just always use `/` in patterns.

### UNC Paths

On Windows, UNC paths like `//?/c:/...` or
`//ComputerName/Share/...` are handled specially.

- Patterns starting with a double-slash followed by some
  non-slash characters will preserve their double-slash. As a
  result, a pattern like `//*` will match `//x`, but not `/x`.
- Patterns staring with `//?/<drive letter>:` will _not_ treat
  the `?` as a wildcard character. Instead, it will be treated
  as a normal string.
- Patterns starting with `//?/<drive letter>:/...` will match
  file paths starting with `<drive letter>:/...`, and vice versa,
  as if the `//?/` was not present. This behavior only is
  present when the drive letters are a case-insensitive match to
  one another. The remaining portions of the path/pattern are
  compared case sensitively, unless `nocase:true` is set.

Note that specifying a UNC path using `\` characters as path
separators is always allowed in the file path argument, but only
allowed in the pattern argument when `windowsPathsNoEscape: true`
is set in the options.

## Minimatch Class

Create a minimatch object by instantiating the `minimatch.Minimatch` class.

```javascript
var Minimatch = require('minimatch').Minimatch
var mm = new Minimatch(pattern, options)
```

### Properties

- `pattern` The original pattern the minimatch object represents.
- `options` The options supplied to
